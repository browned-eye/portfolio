Drone technology is rapidly evolving and aerial images are becoming an increasingly rich data source. Whirld combines technical features like computer vision and machine learning with interface designs that encourage online collaboration into a platform of peer produced, user generated projects. Whirld will drive public engaging in creating a positive vision of what drone and aerial imagery technologies can achieve in the future.'",

Pipeline and Railroad Incidents, 2005-2014","'Between 2010-2015, there were numerous catastrophic oil spills along railways and pipelines in the United States. Recent news coverage of railway and pipeline spills have lacked comprehensive information about where rail and pipeline incidents are occurring and if the locations of these incidents has changed over time. This project attempts to analyze the the types of materials being spilled over railways and from pipelines. This paper also identifies geographic “hot spots” (areas where incidents are more likely to occur) for railway and pipeline spills and investigates whether or not these geographic hotspots have changed over time.'",

Squeezing a sensor inside the a dropper causes the fractal to expand in size on the screen. A potentiometer sensor gives the user a tangible way to manipulate the perspective that the fractals are shown on screen.,
Sybil Attacks,sybil,Fall 2013,sybil_0.jpg,,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByLGxcGIhaSVRDNscGVRekV2a3c/view?usp=sharing,10,"UC Berkeley I School 219-Privacy, Security and Cryptography Semester Long Research Paper",,"Reliability, BitTorrent Protocol, and Sybil Attacks- A Research Paper","This paper examines the extent to which bitTorrent peer to peer(P2P) networks are reliable alternatives to the traditional centralized client-server networks. The first part of this paper is a short narrative on how I had hoped to create a bitTorrent network that that could guarantee reliability, but, instead, discover that creating a reliable bitTorrent network is an impossible feat in the face of a Sybil attack. The second part of the paper more formally examines the specifics of bitTorrent Protocol and Sybil attacks and discusses how a bitTorrent's network size plays a key role in determining how vulnerable it is to a Sybil attack.",
