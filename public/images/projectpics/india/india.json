Plotting the data by year reveals an increase in the number of domestic abuse cases. This could be because either 1) Number of cases of domestic abuse has actually risen dramatically 2) Women are beginning to speak up more about domestic abuse than before."

Interestingly, the first bar graph reveals that over 40% of all human trafficking crimes are committed by women against other women. We also evaluated the ages of the offenders. The majority of female offenders are ages 30-60 years old and commit domestic cruelty and dowry offenses. This suggests that middle-aged female offenders are in-laws or relatives that violently harass other women over dowry payments or other domestic disputes. Based on the Delhi gang rape verdict for the juvenile offenders, we also wanted to evaluate the ratio of juvenile male perpetrators. Most male offenders are between 18-30 years old; males below 18 years are the least likely to be involved."

We also made a hierarchical bar chart in d3 to understand the breakdown of crime statistics by state and the long tail of distribution of these crimes. <br><br> In retrospect, the hierarchical bar graph could be visually improved limiting the length of the long tail; limiting the long tail would make it for the user to make comparisons between different states were the most crimes occur."

The data showed that the number of total perpetrators keeps decreasing through the stages from from arrest through chargesheeted to conviction.  We created a sunburst diagram in d3 to show this, however, based on user testing, we found that visualization did not seem to work for most users, and had to be demonstrated by us explicitly. Even after a demo, users did not find the visualization confusing, so we eliminated from the final deliverable."
