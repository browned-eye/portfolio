For the data mining final project, I team was interested in exploring trends published on social media platforms. <br><br>TubesTrends is an ETL that makes a series of automated OO-ruby scripts make API calls and scrape websites. The automation allows internet trend data to be collected 24/7.<br><br>I tried to use the collected to data because I wanted a way to: <br>1. See aggregated internet trends in real time and over the long-term.<br>2.Compare and contrast what's “trending” on different internet and social media platforms to see if there are similar common themes."
